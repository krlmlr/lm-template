    The spacing between this
    \begin{flushleft}
    and the following paragraph is good.
    \end{flushleft}%
    \color{red}%
    \begin{flushleft} But here comes trouble. Why is the red block two parskips away?
    \end{flushleft}
    \color{blue}%
    Changing from flushleft to regular doesn't add space even when color is changed.
    \begin{flushleft} 
    \color{green}%
    Neither does changing color inside flushleft.
    \end{flushleft}

    \end{document}
