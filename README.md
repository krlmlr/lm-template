lm-template
===========

A template for a LaTeX MWE (minimal working example) usually required to submit
questions or problems to helper sites, forums or mailing lists.
Please feel free to fork and/or improve!

Examples for problems I am encountering are stored in branches.

A `Makefile` is supplied which supports, among others,
compilation to PDF, PNG (at 150 dpi, cropped), and Open Document Format
(using `mk4ht`).
