\section{Normal size}

This is a sample of typed text in normal size and with a normal baseline skip -- nothing special.

\section{Size changed in block}

  {\fontsize{15}{20}\selectfont
Here, the baseline skip has been altered in a block delimited by curly braces. The font size has changed, but the baseline skip is weird.
  }

\section{Size changed outside of block}

  \fontsize{15}{20}\selectfont
Everything works as expected outside a block: The baseline skip is considerably larger here.

\section{Size restored}

\normalsize
This is a sample of typed text in normal size and with a normal baseline skip -- nothing special.

\section{Size changed in block for Lorem Ipsum}

  {\fontsize{15}{20}\selectfont\lipsum[1]}
